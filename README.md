Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in DS
Web Development Project
  This projects demonstrates all the internal workings of standard soring algorithms which includes bubble sort,inserion sort,selection sort,merge sort ,quick sort and heap sort
  Each step is represented by colors(in bar)
    Blue is default color ,for comparing elements yellow is used,for element movement red and green for correctly placed elements.
    This application includes user controls like generate new array-generates array depends on size ,visulization speed for controlling the speed of the algorithm
    Displays the all possible time complexities -best,worst and average case depending on the sorting algorithm selected 
    Technologies Used:HTML,CSS,JavaScript
