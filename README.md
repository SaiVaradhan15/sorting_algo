# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in DS

## Web Development Project

This project demonstrates all the internal workings of standard sorting algorithms which includes **bubble sort**, **insertion sort**, **selection sort**, **merge sort**, **quick sort**, and **heap sort**.

Each step is represented by colors (in bars):
- **Blue** is the default color  
- For comparing elements, **yellow** is used  
- For element movement, **red**  
- **Green** for correctly placed elements  

This application includes user controls like:
- **Generate New Array** – Generates an array depending on size  
- **Visualization Speed** – For controlling the speed of the algorithm  

Displays all possible time complexities — **best**, **worst**, and **average case**, depending on the sorting algorithm selected.
